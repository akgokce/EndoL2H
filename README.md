## Overview

We propose and quantitatively validate a novel framework to learn a mapping from low-to-high resolution endoscopic images. We combine conditional adversarial networks with a spatial attention block to improve the resolution by up to factors of 8x, 10x, 12x, respectively. EndoL2H is generally applicable to any endoscopic capsule system and has the potential to improve diagnosis and better harness computational approaches for polyp detection and characterization.

Our main contributions are as follows:
  - **Spatial Attention-based Super Resolution cGAN:** We propose a spatial attention based super-resolution cGAN architecture specifically designed and optimized for capsule endoscopy images.
  - **High fidelity loss function:** We introduce *EndoL2H* loss which is a weighted hybrid loss function specifically optimized for endoscopic images. It collaboratively combines the strengths of perceptual, content, texture, and pixel-based loss descriptions and improves image quality in terms of pixel values, content, and texture. This combination leads to the maintenance of the image quality even under high scaling factors up to, 10x-12x.
  - **Qualitative and quantitative study:** We conduct a detailed quantitative analysis to assess the effectiveness of our proposed approach and compare it to alternative state-of-the art approaches.

#### Summary of Our Work 
  
A conditional GAN combined with spatial attention unit maps low resolution(LR) endo-scopic images to diagnostically relevant  high resolution(HR) endoscopic images. Unlike an unconditional GAN, both the generator and discriminator observe the input LR images.

#### Network Architecture

**a)** Overall system architecture of EndoL2H super-resolution framework. On the left, low resolution image is fed to generator network that creates an estimated high resolution counterpart, which is then served to discriminator. Discriminator network takes both LR image and the corresponding HR image (real or generated), and tries to recognize whether the HR image is real or fake., layers and skip-connections of attention U-Net is depicted in detail, below that, **b)** is the flow diagram of spatial attention block(SAB). On top of the figure **c)** represents the feature maps of attention U-Net which is the summary of applied filters and their input-output tensor sizes.

#### Super-resolution results on 8×enlargement

Each set consists of low resolution image,high  resolution  image,  SRGAN,  DBPN,  RCAN  and  EndoL2H,  respectively. 

First two rows are SR results for esophagitis which is basically inflammatory disease of esophagus, ulcerative colitis similarly inflammatory bowel disease and polyps abnormal growth of mucous membrane of small and large intestine. The others are the tuples to show EndoL2H inputs and their corresponding attention maps merged representations.

#### The evaluation of image groups in terms of structural similarity

**a)** Resulting GMSD maps. Red  color denotes  higher GMSD  values  indicating low  structural similarity with  the  original image  and blue color  represents  low  GMSD  values indicating a high  structural similarity with the original image.

**b)** Resulting SSIM heat maps. Red  color  denotes  lower SSIM  values  representing a low  structural  similarity  with  the  original  image  and  blue  color  represent  high  SSIM  values representing a high structural similarity with the original image.
